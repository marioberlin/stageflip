# Runtime Tiers

A clip is a unit of motion that the renderer dispatches to a registered
runtime. StageFlip ships **three runtime tiers** so each clip kind picks the
fastest path that still produces correct output.

| Tier | Where it runs | When to use | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frame-deterministic** | JS, in-browser preview + CDP export | Math-driven motion (interpolate, spring, easing); same frame number → same pixels | `@stageflip/frame-runtime` |
| **Interactive** | Live JS engine in a sandbox | Frontier clips that mount real DOM/WebGL — `liveMount` + `staticFallback` per ADR-005 | `@stageflip/runtimes/interactive` |
| **Bake** | Offline worker (Blender 4.2 LTS) | Heavy 3D scenes, ray-tracing, photoreal materials that cannot run live | `@stageflip/runtimes/blender` (T-265) |

Per ADR-003, every `ClipDefinition` declares which tiers it supports. The
renderer-core dispatcher picks the highest-quality available output that
fits the export budget.

## Bake tier (T-265)

A bake-tier clip ships its scene + parameters to a Blender worker, which
renders frames offline and uploads them to a content-addressed cache:

```
bakes/{inputsHash}/frame-{N}.png   (architecture-locked path,
                                    docs/architecture.md:330)
bakes/{inputsHash}/manifest.json   (frameCount, fps, region, completedAt)
```

The cache key — `inputsHash` — is the **whole game**. Same `{scene,
duration}` → same hash → cache hit; any input change → new hash → re-bake.
Wrong canonicalization here means cache poisoning, missed cache hits, or
duplicate bakes for the same intent. Pinned in `inputs-hash.test.ts`:

- Field order in objects is normalized (sorted-key JSON canonicalization).
- Field types are NOT coerced: `1` and `"1"` produce different hashes.
- Arrays preserve order (semantic).
- `bigint`, non-finite numbers, and circular structures are rejected.

### Lifecycle

1. **Author** creates a `BlenderClip` element with `scene + duration`.
   Editor computes `inputsHash` and pins it in the document.
2. **Submit** — caller invokes the `submitBakeJob` Cloud Function. Handler
   verifies `requireAuth`, debits 10 tokens from the org's rate-limit
   bucket (bake is ~10x more expensive than a normal request), recomputes
   the hash, and either short-circuits (cache hit) or enqueues a BullMQ job
   on `stageflip:bakes`.
3. **Render** — a `services/blender-worker` container consumes from
   `stageflip:bakes`, opens the scene template, applies parameters, and
   renders `[0, ceil(durationMs/1000 * fps))` frames via Cycles in
   deterministic mode (`use_persistent_data = True`, fixed seed,
   `use_denoising = False`, pinned sample count). The worker is **idempotent
   on `manifest.json`**: if it sees the manifest at the output path, it
   short-circuits successfully — required because BullMQ delivery is
   at-least-once and a duplicate-delivery race must not produce two
   parallel bakes.
4. **Fetch** — clients poll `getBakedFrames(inputsHash, { region })`. The
   call returns one of `'ready' | 'pending' | 'failed'` based on whether
   `manifest.json`, neither marker, or `bake_failed.json` is present.

### Region routing

Bake outputs respect `org.region` per T-271. The submit handler reads the
caller's region from their org doc; the worker writes to either the US
(`stageflip-assets`) or EU (`stageflip-eu-assets`) bucket. The cache key
is region-namespaced **only by bucket** — the path
`bakes/{inputsHash}/...` is the same in both regions.

### GPU / CPU dual-path (D-T265-7)

The worker tries GPU rendering first when `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set;
on CUDA failure, it retries on CPU and emits a `bake.cpu_fallback` warning.
CPU is ~10x slower but produces identical output thanks to Cycles'
deterministic mode.

### Determinism contract

Same `inputsHash` → byte-identical frames. This is pinned by:

- `bpy.context.scene.cycles.use_persistent_data = True`
- `cycles.seed = 0`
- `cycles.use_denoising = False`
- `cycles.samples = 64`

If you change any of these defaults, the cache is silently invalidated for
existing hashes. Bump the canonicalization rule explicitly and document the
migration.

## Render farm deployment (T-266)

The bake worker runs somewhere — local dev uses a child process; production
uses a GPU-cloud vendor. T-266 ships **`@stageflip/render-farm`**, an
adapter abstraction that decouples the bake worker from the vendor choice:

```ts
import { getRenderFarmAdapter } from '@stageflip/render-farm';
const adapter = getRenderFarmAdapter(process.env);
const { jobId } = await adapter.submitJob({
  bakeId, image, resources: { cpu, memoryGB, gpu: 'cuda' }, env: { ... },
});
```

The `RenderFarmAdapter` contract (`packages/render-farm/src/contract.ts`)
defines `submitJob`, `cancelJob`, `getJobStatus`, optional `streamLogs`, and
`capabilities` (which features are real vs stubs). All methods emit OTel
spans tagged with `vendor`, `jobId`, `state`, `duration_ms`.

### Adapters shipped in T-266

- **`InMemoryRenderFarmAdapter`** — runs the worker as a child process via
  `node:child_process`. Used for local dev + tests + the parity harness.
  Capabilities: `cpu-only`, streaming logs, `maxConcurrentJobs: 4`.
- **`KubernetesRenderFarmAdapter` stub** — class skeleton with all methods
  throwing `NotImplementedError`. `capabilities.maxConcurrentJobs: 0`
  signals "not deployed". A vendor implementation lands when first prod
  load demands it.

### Vendor selection

Production env sets `STAGEFLIP_RENDER_FARM_ADAPTER=k8s` (or a future vendor
key). The selector throws on unknown values — silent fallback to
`in-memory` would mis-route prod bake load.

Current vendor: **none** (in-memory only). Future options + cost/throughput
tradeoffs: see `docs/ops/render-farm-vendors.md`. v1 recommendation is
self-hosted K8s on GKE Autopilot; the adapter pattern means we can swap.

### State-marker protocol

The in-memory adapter drives lifecycle transitions by parsing two stdout
markers from the worker:

```
STAGEFLIP_RENDER_FARM_STARTED bakeId=<id>
STAGEFLIP_RENDER_FARM_FINISHED bakeId=<id> status=<succeeded|failed> [error=<msg>]
```

The worker emits these around `processBakeJob`. Real K8s adapters ignore
them (they read pod state from the Kubernetes API) — the markers are only
load-bearing for the in-memory path.

## Interactive runtime tier (T-306)

The interactive tier is the host for **frontier clips** — voice, AI chat,
live data, web embeds, AI generative, shaders, three-scene — that
structurally cannot live under the §3 determinism rule (mic streams, live
LLM round-trips, `requestAnimationFrame`-driven WebGL, etc.). Per
ADR-003 §D5, `packages/runtimes/interactive/**` is OUT of scope for
`pnpm check-determinism`. T-309 will add a shader sub-rule that re-applies
determinism inside the tier (`uFrame`-only uniform updaters); T-306 ships
only the package-level exemption.

Every interactive clip declares **both paths** (ADR-003 §D2):

- `staticFallback: CanonicalElement[]` — frame-runtime renders this for
  parity-safe export targets (MP4, image-sequence, PPTX-flat,
  display-pre-rendered). Subject to PSNR + SSIM parity.
- `liveMount: { component, props, permissions }` — the interactive tier
  mounts this for HTML / live-presentation / display-interactive /
  on-device-player. Not subject to parity.

T-305 ships the schema; T-306 ships the runtime tier package
(`@stageflip/runtimes-interactive`). T-308 will add `check-preset-integrity`
to enforce that no clip declares only `liveMount`.

### Public surface

```ts
import {
  InteractiveMountHarness,
  PermissionShim,
  interactiveClipRegistry,
  contractTestSuite,         // from /contract-tests subpath
} from '@stageflip/runtimes-interactive';
```

- **`InteractiveMountHarness.mount(clip, root, signal)`** — programmatic
  mount/unmount/dispose.
- **`PermissionShim`** — mount-time permission gate.
- **`interactiveClipRegistry`** — module-level singleton; Phase γ clip
  packages call `register('shader', shaderFactory)` at import time.
- **`contractTestSuite(factory)`** — Vitest `describe` block every Phase γ
  family runs against its own factory.

### Mount flow + security model

The harness orchestrates four steps in this exact order; getting them
wrong breaks the security model.

```
harness.mount(clip, root, signal):
  1. permissionShim.mount(clip)
       a. tenantPolicy.canMount(family)        # ADR-003 §D4 step 1 + ADR-005 §D3
            → false: emit 'tenant-denied'; route to staticFallback
       b. for permission in liveMount.permissions:
            mic    → getUserMedia({audio:true})
            camera → getUserMedia({video:true})
            network → no-op (assumed granted)
            → denied: emit 'permission-denied'; route to staticFallback
       c. cache successful grants per-(session, family); skip re-prompt
  2. registry.resolve(family) || throw InteractiveClipNotRegisteredError
  3. factory(MountContext)
  4. signal.abort → MountHandle.dispose() (idempotent)
```

**Critical invariants:**

- Tenant-policy gate runs BEFORE any `getUserMedia` call. A
  feature-flagged-off tenant must never see a permission dialog.
- Idempotent `dispose()` — both manual and `signal.abort`-driven paths
  converge on the same cleanup; double-dispose is a no-op.
- On any denial, the harness renders `staticFallback` via
  `renderStaticFallback` (React 19 root API). The export pipeline (per
  ADR-003 §D3) continues to function — the live mount degrades, the
  document still ships.
- Permission cache is session-scoped (instance lifetime). A page reload
  resets it; the user's browser-level permission state persists
  independently.

### Determinism posture

By ADR-003 §D5, code under `packages/runtimes/interactive/**` may use
`Date.now`, `performance.now`, `Math.random`, `setTimeout`,
`setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `fetch`, `MediaRecorder`,
`getUserMedia`, `Worker`, etc. The exemption is enforced via
`scripts/check-determinism.ts` `EXCLUDED_PREFIXES` — narrow to only this
path; existing scope on `packages/frame-runtime/`,
`packages/runtimes/blender/**/clips/**`, and `packages/renderer-core/clips/**`
remains untouched.

### Browser-bundle posture

The package is browser-side runtime. It MUST NOT import `fs`, `path`, or
`child_process`. Its dependencies are `@stageflip/schema` (browser-safe
surface), and `react` / `react-dom` as peer deps. `pnpm size-limit` is the
canary for accidental Node-only imports.
